# mcmod-workflow

This is a (relatively) simple shared GitHub Actions workflow I use for my mods.

It is used in conjunction with actions from [necauqua/changelogs](https://github.com/necauqua/changelogs) to automatically generate a changelog and `updates.json` file (and store them in the wiki repo), as well as to automatically build and publish my mods to all the things: GitHub Releases, CurseForge, Modrinth, maven.necauqua.dev and GitHub Packages (also Maven).
